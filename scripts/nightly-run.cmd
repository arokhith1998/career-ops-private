REM nightly-run.cmd - thin wrapper around scripts/nightly-phase.mjs.
REM
REM Registered with Windows Task Scheduler as ONE task with three daily
REM triggers (see scripts/register-nightly-task.ps1):
REM
REM   23:00  discover   boards slice 1 + repos slice 1 + LinkedIn slice 1
REM   04:00  discover   boards slice 2 + repos slice 2 + LinkedIn slice 2
REM   09:00  build      full packs, serially, from the finalized queue
REM
REM Task Scheduler cannot pass a different argument per trigger, so the
REM driver picks its phase from the clock with --auto. Pass an explicit
REM phase to override.
REM
REM Runs LOCALLY on purpose: config/profile.yml, data/applications.md,
REM portals.yml and output/ are all gitignored, so a cloud runner cannot
REM see the profile, the tracker or the packs already built, and would
REM duplicate work every single night.

REM Timestamped log per run. The task reports success even when a step failed,
REM so the log and reports/nightly/{date}-digest.md are the real record.

REM Reap claude.exe sessions orphaned by a hard-terminated previous run. Only
REM kills processes whose PARENT IS GONE and that are over 2h old, so a live
REM interactive session is never a candidate - verified 2026-09-11, when it
REM correctly reported 0 of 20 live processes as orphans.
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "scripts\reap-claude.ps1" -Execute >> "%LOG%" 2>&1

REM The driver runs the zero-token stages in process, then opens ONE short-lived
REM claude session per step with its own model and timeout. It appends to the
REM digest after every step, so a killed step can no longer lose the night.
REM Run under a WAKE LOCK. On 2026-09-12 the 23:00 run took 10h21m of wall clock
REM because the machine entered modern standby twice mid-run (00:16-05:50 and
REM 05:51-09:16). It was therefore still "running" at 04:00 and 09:00, and
REM MultipleInstances=IgnoreNew silently SKIPPED both of those runs - nothing was
REM built that day. Sleep is off on AC but 180s on battery, so this bites
REM whenever the laptop is unplugged. run-awake.ps1 holds ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED for
REM the life of the run and releases it on exit.
