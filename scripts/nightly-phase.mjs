/**
 * nightly-phase.mjs — the nightly driver. Replaces the single `claude -p` call
 * that used to run the whole night in one Opus session.
 *
 * WHY
 *
 * The old scripts/nightly-run.cmd made ONE headless call on opus[1m] and asked
 * it to do everything. Consequences, both observed:
 *   2026-09-08 08:10  "You've hit your session limit", exit 1 at 27 minutes,
 *                     7 pack folders holding a single file each
 *   2026-09-09 02:00  killed at Stage F, "Background tasks still running after
 *                     600s", no digest, and the whole budget spent backfilling
 *                     the previous night
 * Neither run ever wrote reports/nightly/{date}-digest.md - the one file she is
 * supposed to open in the morning.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FIXES
 *
 * 1. ZERO-TOKEN STAGES RUN HERE, IN PROCESS, ALWAYS. Boards, repos, LinkedIn,
 *    the seen-jobs filter, the shortlist and the JD experience gate are plain
 *    Node. No agent can skip them or work from a stale file. That is the Cox
 *    fix: "Business Intelligence Manager" got a full pack because the 04:00 run
 *    built from the previous night's shortlist.tsv, while the filter that
 *    rejects that exact title (nightly-shortlist.mjs, with a unit test for it)
 *    sat right there unused.
 *
 * 2. ONE SESSION PER STEP, each with its own model and timeout. A step that
 *    hangs is killed and recorded; the next step still runs.
 *
 * 3. THE DIGEST IS APPENDED AFTER EVERY STEP, by this driver, not by an agent
 *    at the end. So it exists even if every agent dies.
 *
 * PHASES (config/nightly.yml -> schedule.runs)
 *
 *   23:00  discover   boards slice 1 + repos slice 1 + LinkedIn slice 1
 *   04:00  discover   boards slice 2 + repos slice 2 + LinkedIn slice 2
 *   09:00  build      full packs, serially, from the queue 04:00 finalized
 *
 * A discover run writes NO artifacts. A build run scrapes nothing.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/nightly-phase.mjs --phase discover
 *   node scripts/nightly-phase.mjs --phase build
 *   node scripts/nightly-phase.mjs --auto            # phase from the clock
 *   node scripts/nightly-phase.mjs --phase discover --dry-run   # no agents
 *   node scripts/nightly-phase.mjs --plan            # print the plan, run nothing

 * Now: extraction writes jds/ and stops. The gate reads jds/ in a clean session.
