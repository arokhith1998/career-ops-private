.SYNOPSIS
  Kill orphaned claude.exe processes left behind by dead nightly runs.

.DESCRIPTION
  Every nightly step opens a short-lived `claude -p` session. When the driver is
  hard-terminated (the 09:00 and 16:00 build runs were repeatedly killed by a
  console control event, exit 0xC000013A) its child session is NOT reaped: it
  keeps running, holding memory and drawing on the same account quota the next
  run needs.

  Measured 2026-09-11 23:20: 21 live claude.exe, the oldest running since
  05:48 that morning with 23 minutes of accumulated CPU. Later that same night
  the 08:20 run died with "You've hit your session limit". Those two facts are
  almost certainly the same fact.

  SAFETY. This only kills a process that is BOTH:
    1. a true orphan - its parent process no longer exists, and
    2. older than -MinAgeHours (default 2).

  A claude.exe belonging to a live session always has a live parent (the shell,
  the desktop app, or a running nightly-phase.mjs), so an interactive session in
  use is never a candidate. The current process tree is excluded explicitly as a
  second belt.
