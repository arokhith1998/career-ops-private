.SYNOPSIS
  Registers (or updates) the Windows Task Scheduler job that runs the career-ops
  nightly pipeline.

.DESCRIPTION
  Creates a task named "career-ops-nightly" that runs scripts\nightly-run.cmd
  every night at the given time, under the current user, whether or not she is
  logged in.

  The task runs LOCALLY on purpose. config/profile.yml, data/applications.md,
  portals.yml and output/ are gitignored, so a cloud runner cannot read the
  profile, the tracker, or the packs already built.

.PARAMETER At
  Start times, 24h "HH:mm". One trigger is created per value.

  Default 23:00, 04:00, 09:00 - her schedule as of 2026-09-09:
    23:00  discover  boards slice 1 + repos slice 1 + LinkedIn slice 1
    04:00  discover  boards slice 2 + repos slice 2 + LinkedIn slice 2
    09:00  build     full packs, serially, from the finalized queue

  Task Scheduler cannot pass a different argument per trigger, so the runner
  calls scripts/nightly-phase.mjs --auto, which picks its phase from the clock
  against config/nightly.yml -> schedule.runs. Keep the two in sync: change the
  times here AND there, or a 09:00 trigger will run the discover phase.

.PARAMETER RunWhenLoggedOut
  Use the S4U logon type so the run fires even when nobody is signed in.
  REQUIRES AN ELEVATED POWERSHELL - Windows denies S4U registration to a
  standard shell. Without this switch the task uses the Interactive logon type,
  which registers without admin and fires whenever she is signed in, including
  when the screen is locked.

.PARAMETER Unregister
  Remove the task instead of creating it.

.EXAMPLE
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\register-nightly-task.ps1
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\register-nightly-task.ps1 -At 23:00,04:00,09:00
