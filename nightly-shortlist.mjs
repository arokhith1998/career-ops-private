/**
 * nightly-shortlist.mjs — Zero-token filter + rank stage of the nightly pipeline.
 *
 * Sits between scrape-job-repos.mjs (raw feed) and the LLM agents. Its whole job
 * is to make sure no token is ever spent on a posting that is already applied
 * to, already built, structurally out of scope, or a known hard wall.
 *
 * Inputs:
 *   data/job-feed.tsv         from scrape-job-repos.mjs
 *   data/applications.md      the tracker — the authority on "already seen"
 *   output/                   built packs — a pack on disk counts as seen even
 *                             when the tracker row was never written (packs have
 *                             gone half-built and unlogged before)
 *   config/nightly.yml        role families, caps, thresholds
 *   config/industries.yml     the candidate's target industries (optional)
 *   data/skip-list.tsv        employers/reqs the visa gate already ruled out
 *
 * Output: a ranked TSV shortlist. The heuristic score RANKS candidates for the
 * agents to evaluate; it never decides fit. Only the LLM evaluation assigns the
 * real /5 score, and only Agent 3 decides the visa question.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node nightly-shortlist.mjs                       # rank, print summary
 *   node nightly-shortlist.mjs --out data/shortlist.tsv
 *   node nightly-shortlist.mjs --limit 40
 *   node nightly-shortlist.mjs --json
 *   node nightly-shortlist.mjs --explain             # show why rows were dropped
